# Coronavirus by US State Heatmaps

Clone this repository and run coronavirus_heatmap.py to scrape case data from wikipedia and save two interactive .html heatmaps in the current working directory. The first heatmap will show cases by state, while the second shows the mortality rate by state.

Requires plotly, pandas, and requests.

### Note: The Wikipedia source data changes its structure frequently, I will update as often as possible but will likely change to a new source in the near future.
